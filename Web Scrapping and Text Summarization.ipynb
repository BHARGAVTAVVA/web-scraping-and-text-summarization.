      "Alexander the Great\n",
      "Alexander III of Macedon was a king of the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedona. He succeeded his father Philip II to the throne in BC at the age of  25. He spent most of his ruling years conducting a lengthy military campaign throughout Western Asia and Egypt. He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered to be one of historys greatest and most successful military commanders.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "Early life\n",
      "Until the age of  Alexander was tutored by Aristotle. In BC shortly after his assumption of kingship over Macedon he reasserted control over Thrace and parts of Illyria.

      "==================================================\n",
      "Lineage and childhood\n",
      "In BC he invaded the Achaemenid Persian Empire and began a series of campaigns that lasted for years.

Due to the demand of his homesick troops he eventually turned back at the Beas River and later died in BC in Babylon.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "Education\n",
      "With his death marking the start of the Hellenistic period Alexanders legacy includes the cultural diffusion and syncretism that his conquests engendered. The Greek language became the lingua franca of the region and was the predominant language of the Byzantine Empire up until its collapse in the midth century AD. Alexander became legendary as a classical hero in the mould of Achilles.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "Heir of Philip II\n",
      "Alexander III was the son of the erstwhile king of Macedon Philip II and his fourth wife Olympias daughter of Neoptolemus I king of Epirus. Although Philip had seven or eight wives Olympias was his principal wife for some time likely because she gave birth to Alexander.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "Regency and ascent of Macedon\n",
      "Several legends surround Alexanders birth and childhood. According to the ancient Greek biographer Plutarch Olympias dreamed that her womb was struck by a thunderbolt that caused a flame to spread far and wide before dying away. Philip is said to have seen himself in a dream securing his wifes womb with a seal engraved with a lions image.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "Exile and return\n",
      "On the day Alexander was born Philip was preparing a siege on the city of Potidea on the peninsula of Chalcidice That same day Philip received news that his general Parmenion had defeated the combined Illyrian and Paeonian armies and that his horses had won at the Olympic Games. It was also said that on this day the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus one of the Seven Wonders of the World burnt down.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "King of Macedon\n",
      "In his early years Alexander was raised by a nurse Lanike sister of Alexanders future general Cleitus the Black Later in his childhood Alexander was tutored by the strict Leonidas a relative of his mother and by Lysimachus of Acarnania. He was raised in the manner of noble Macedonian youths learning to read play the lyre ride fight and hunt.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "Accession\n",
      "When Alexander was  Philip began to search for a tutor and considered such academics as Isocrates and Speusippus. In the end Philip chose Aristotle and provided the Temple of the Nymphs at Mieza as a classroom. In return for teaching Alexander Philip agreed to rebuild Aristotles hometown of Stageira which Philip had razed.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "Consolidation of power\n",
      "Mieza was like a boarding school for Alexander and the children of Macedonian nobles such as Ptolemy Hephaistion and Cassander. Many of these students would become his friends and future generals and are often known as the Companions Aristotle taught Alexander and his companions about medicine philosophy morals religion logic and art.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "Balkan campaign\n",
      "Alexander was able to quote Euripides from memory. He was speaking to a group of students at the University of Cambridge. The students were studying the ancient Greek playwright Euripide. Alexander said he could quote the play from memory as well as from his own memory.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "Destruction of Thebes\n",
      "During his youth Alexander was also acquainted with Persian exiles at the Macedonian court who received the protection of Philip II for several years as they opposed Artaxerxes III. Among them were Artabazos II and his daughter Barsine possible future mistress of Alexander.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "Conquest of the Achaemenid Persian Empire\n",
      "Suda writes that Anaximenes of Lampsacus was one of Alexanders teachers. He also accompanied Alexander on his campaigns. He was a pupil of Alexander's father, Alexander the Great. Alexander was also a friend of the king of Macedon, Alexander the Great.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "Asia Minor\n",

      "==================================================\n",
      "The Levant and Syria\n",
      "Alexander was dispatched with a small force to subdue the revolts in southern Thrace Campaigning against the Greek city of Perinthus Alexander reportedly saved his fathers life.

      "==================================================\n",
      "Egypt\n",
      "Philip and his army joined his son in BC and they marched south through Thermopylae taking it after stubborn resistance from its Theban garrison.

      "==================================================\n",
      "Assyria and Babylonia\n",
      "As Philip marched south his opponents blocked him near Chaeronea Boeotia. Philip deliberately commanded his troops to retreat counting on the untested Athenian hoplites to follow. Alexander was the first to break the Theban lines followed by Philips generals. With the Athenians lost the Thebans were surrounded Left to fight alone they were defeated\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "Persia\n",
      "After the victory at Chaeronea Philip and Alexander marched unopposed into the Peloponnese welcomed by all cities however when they reached Sparta they were refused but did not resort to war. At Corinth Philip established a Hellenic Alliance modelled on the old antiPersian alliance of the GrecoPersian Wars which included most Greek citystates except Sparta Philip was then named Hegemon often translated as Supreme Commander of this league.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "Fall of the Persian Empire and the East\n",
      "When Philip returned to Pella he fell in love with and married Cleopatra Eurydice in BC the niece of his general Attalus. The marriage made Alexanders position as heir less secure since any son of Cleopatre EuryDice would be a fully Macedonian heir while Alexander was only half Macedonian. During the wedding banquet a drunken Attalus publicly prayed to the gods that the union would produce a legitimate heir.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "Problems and plots\n",
      "At the wedding of Cleopatra whom Philip fell in love with and married she being much too young for him her uncle Attalus in his drink desired the Macedonians would implore the gods to give them a lawful successor to the kingdom by his niece. This so irritated Alexander that throwing one of the cups at his head You villain said he what am I then a bastard.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "Macedon in Alexanders absence\n",
      "In BC Alexander fled Macedon with his mother dropping her off with her brother King Alexander I of Epirus in Dodona capital of the Molossians.

      "==================================================\n",
      "Indian campaign\n",
      "In summer BC while at Aegae attending the wedding of his daughter Cleopatra to Olympiass brother Alexander I of Epirus Philip was assassinated. As Pausanias tried to escape he tripped over a vine and was killed by his pursuers including two of Alexanders companions Perdiccas and Leonnatus Alexander was proclaimed king on the spot by the nobles and army.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "Forays into the Indian subcontinent\n",
      "Alexander began his reign by eliminating potential rivals to the throne. He had his cousin the former Amyntas IV executed. He also had two Macedonian princes from the region of Lyncestis killed for having been involved in his fathers assassination. Lyncestes Olympias had Cleopatra Eurydice and Europa her daughter by Philip burned alive.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "Revolt of the Hellenic army\n",
      "Attalus was at that time corresponding with Demosthenes regarding the possibility of defecting to Athens. Attalus also had severely insulted Alexander and following Cleopatras murder Alexander may have considered him too dangerous to be left alive.

      "==================================================\n",
      "Last years in Persia\n",
      "News of Philips death roused many states into revolt including Thebes Athens Thessaly and the Thracian tribes north of Macedon.

      "==================================================\n",
      "Postdeath events\n",

      "==================================================\n",
      "Last plans\n",
      "While Alexander campaigned north the Thebans and Athenians rebelled once again Alexander immediately headed south. While the other cities again hesitated Thebes decided to fight The Theban resistance was ineffective and Alexander razed the city and divided its territory between the other Boeotian cities. The end of Thebes cowed Athens leaving all of Greece temporarily at peace.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "Character\n",
      "After his victory at the Battle of Chaeronea  BC Philip II began the work of establishing himself as hēgemṓn Greek.

      "==================================================\n",
      "Generalship\n",
      "Alexanders army crossed the Hellespont in BC with approximately  soldiers  cavalry and a fleet of ships. He showed his intent to conquer the entirety of the Persian Empire by throwing a spear into Asian soil and saying he accepted Asia as a gift from the gods.

      "==================================================\n",
      "Physical appearance\n",
      "After an initial victory against Persian forces at the Battle of the Granicus Alexander accepted the surrender of the Persian provincial capital and treasury of Sardis.

      "==================================================\n",
      "Legacy\n",
      "Egypt was only one of a large number of territories taken by Alexander from the Persians. Alexander was crowned in the temple of Ptah at Memphis. He reformed the taxation system on the Greek models and organized the military occupation of the country. Early in BC he left for Asia in pursuit of thePersians.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "Hellenistic kingdoms\n",
      "Alexander advanced on Egypt in later BC where he was regarded as a liberator. To legitimize taking power and be recognized as the descendant of the long line of pharaohs Alexander made sacrifices to the gods at Memphis. He was pronounced son of the deity Amun at the Oracle of Siwa Oasis in the Libyan desert. Alexander often referred to ZeusAmmon as his true father.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "Founding of cities\n",
      "During his stay in Egypt he founded Alexandria which would become the prosperous capital of the Ptolemaic Kingdom after his death. Control of Egypt passed to P tolemy I son of Lagos after the death of Alexander. He would go on to become the founder of the Ptolemanic Dynasty  BC.\n",

      "Influence on Rome\n",

      "Letters\n",
      "Shall I pass by and leave you lying there because of the expeditions you led against Greece or shall I set you up again because of your magnanimity and your virtues in other respects, asks the king. The king replies that he will set him up again.\n",

      "In legend\n",
      "Alexander chased Darius first into Media and then Parthia. The Persian king no longer controlled his own destiny. He was taken prisoner by Bessus his Bactrian satrap and kinsman. Alexander then declared himself Dariuss successor as Artaxerxes V.\n",

      "==================================================\n",
      "See also\n",
      "During this time Alexander adopted some elements of Persian dress and customs at his court. The Greeks however regarded the gesture of proskynesis as the province of deities and believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it. This cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen and he eventually abandoned it.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "References\n",
      "During the long rule of the Achaemenids the elite positions in many segments of the empire were specifically reserved for Iranians and Persian noblemen.
